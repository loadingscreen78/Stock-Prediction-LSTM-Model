#SmartStock LSTM – Predicting Market Trends with Deep Learning
SmartStock LSTM is a machine learning project designed to forecast stock prices using historical market data from Yahoo Finance. This project applies Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network, to capture temporal patterns in stock market trends and predict the next day’s closing price. The dataset is enhanced with popular technical indicators like RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands for more accurate predictions.

Project Overview
Data Source: Yahoo Finance API, providing Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume data.

Technical Indicators:

RSI – Relative Strength Index

MACD – Moving Average Convergence Divergence

Bollinger Bands

Machine Learning Model: Deep learning model based on LSTM to predict next-day closing prices.

Evaluation Metric: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is used to measure prediction accuracy.

Features
Automated fetching and preprocessing of historical stock data.

Calculation of advanced technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands).

LSTM-based predictive modeling for time series data.

Model performance evaluation with RMSE.

Requirements
Python 3.11.11
